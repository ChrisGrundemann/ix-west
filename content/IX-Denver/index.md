&nbsp;  

IX-Denver was founded in the Denver Gas and Electric building in downtown Denver thanks to 910Telecom. We have since expanded to multiple locations to better serve our members. This is a major step towards a more robust, more reliable, more cost effective, and truly local Internetwork in this region.
