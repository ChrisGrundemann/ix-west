      <p>IX-West is a Colorado non-profit organization that strives to provide open, neutral, community oriented, and membership driven Internet, IT, and Telecommunication interconnectivity in the greater Rocky Mountain West. Our primary objective is to provide a multitude of interconnection options for all organizations throughout Colorado, and beyond.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-facts">Key Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>At its core, IX-West is simply a series of Interconnection eXchanges (IXs).</li>
<li>An IX is a physical infrastructure through which all participating organisations can directly interconnect their networks with each other.</li>
<li><a href="/ix-denver">IX-Denver</a> is the first IX-West IX, serving the Denver metro area.</li>
<li>IX-West is actively seeking partners in all surrounding municipalities and communities to help build additional IXs.</li>
<li>Interconnecting through an IX is typically called “Peering” and is often a lower cost &amp; more secure alternative to buying “Transit” services from a traditional ISP.</li>
<li>Modern IXs, like IX-Denver and all IX-West interconnection exchanges, offer additional value-add services such as private interconnection, layer 2 and layer 3 connectivity options, route servers, DNS root servers, and more.</li>
<li>IX-West is operated in an open, neutral, and community focused manner by a Board of Directors elected by the members themselves.  The business, technology, and innovation are always firmly in the hands of the “customer.”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="who-benefits-from-an-interconnection-exchange-ix">Who Benefits from an Interconnection eXchange (IX)?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Virtually any organization with an IT network or an Internet connection benefits.</li>
<li>Some organizations are able to lower their ISP/Transit bills significantly by Peering directly with the organizations they communicate most frequently.</li>
<li>Other organizations find additional security and peace of mind by Peering with partners directly to avoid sending proprietary, trade secret, and other confidential data over the open (and insecure) Internet.</li>
<li>Still others benefit by bypassing Internet congestion and “choke points”, providing their users a much improved quality of experience.</li>
<li>Many organizations actually fall into more than one of the categories above, thus deriving multiple benefits when joining their local IX.</li>
<li>Additionally, state &amp; local governments benefit by keeping traffic local, reducing the cost of doing businesses, and increasing the stability of our Internet.</li>

          IX-Denver was founded in the Denver Gas and Electric building in downtown Denver. We have since expanded to become the largest internet exchange in the Rocky Mountain region!
